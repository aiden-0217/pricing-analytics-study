# Understanding Price Elasticity in Retail
**Date:** 2025-12-08
**Topic:** Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)

## The Concept
Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) is the fundamental metric used by Pricing Analysts to measure consumer responsiveness. 
It answers the question: *If we change the price, how much will the volume react?* 
It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price:

$$
\epsilon = \frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta P}
$$

## Why is the Coefficient Negative?
In almost all retail scenarios, the elasticity coefficient is **negative**. 
This is a direct reflection of the **Law of Demand**, which dictates an inverse relationship between price and quantity. 
When the price of a product rises, the quantity demanded falls.

## Interpreting the Values

### 1. Elastic Demand ($\epsilon < -1$)
Consumers are **highly sensitive** to price (e.g., luxury goods, products with substitutes).
* **Strategy:** A price **decrease** often leads to higher total revenue (Volume driver).

### 2. Inelastic Demand ($-1 < \epsilon < 0$)
Consumers are **relatively insensitive** to price changes (e.g., necessities).
* **Strategy:** A price **increase** will boost total revenue (Margin driver).

## Analyst Insight
For a Revenue Management Analyst, the goal isn't always to sell more units. 
It is to optimize pricing based on where the product sits on this elasticity spectrum.
