# The Impact of Competitor Pricing
**Date:** 2025-12-09
**Topic:** Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand (CPED)

## The Concept
While **Own Price Elasticity** measures sensitivity to our own price changes, **Cross-Price Elasticity (CPED)** measures how the demand for our product reacts to a price change in a *competitor's* or *related* product.

It answers the question: *If my competitor changes their price, how much will my volume change?*

$$
\epsilon_{A,B} = \frac{\%\Delta Q_A \text{ (Demand for Product A)}}{\%\Delta P_B \text{ (Price of Product B)}}
$$

## Strategic Implications for Analysts

### 1. Substitutes (Positive Elasticity, $\epsilon > 0$)
If the price of Product B goes **UP**, the demand for Product A goes **UP**.
* **Logic:** Consumers switch away from the expensive competitor to our product.
* **Example:** *Generic Neck Pillows* vs. *Silent Pilot*. If generic pillows become expensive, more people might buy Silent Pilot.
* **Strategy:** Monitor competitor price hikes closely; these are opportunities to capture market share without lowering our own price.

### 2. Complements (Negative Elasticity, $\epsilon < 0$)
If the price of Product B goes **UP**, the demand for Product A goes **DOWN**.
* **Logic:** The products are used together. If the main item becomes too expensive, people stop buying the accessories too.
* **Example:** *International Flights* vs. *Travel Pillows*. If flight tickets skyrocket, fewer people travel, and fewer pillows are sold.
* **Strategy:** Consider bundling strategies to create value.

### 3. Independent (Elasticity $\approx 0$)
Price changes in Product B have no effect on Product A.
* **Example:** *Dish soap* prices do not affect *Travel Pillow* sales.

## Analyst Insight
Pricing cannot be done in a vacuum. A robust pricing model must include **Competitor Price Indices** as independent variables in the regression model to accurately forecast demand. Ignoring CPED is a common cause of forecast failure in retail.
