## 1. Executive Summary
This memo analyzes the economic isomorphism (structural similarity) between **Electricity Markets** and **Hotel Revenue Management**. Specifically, it compares the decision logic behind dispatching the **Genesis Energy Huntly Rankine units** during peak load with the decision to **close OTA discount channels** during high-demand periods.

The core finding is that both decisions are driven by **Scarcity Pricing**. When capacity is constrained, pricing shifts from an "Average Cost" model to a **"Marginal Opportunity Cost"** model.

## 2. Electricity Sector: Merit Order Dispatch
In the New Zealand electricity market, generation assets are dispatched based on a **Merit Order**—ranking from lowest to highest marginal cost.

* **Base Load:** Renewable assets like **Mercury NZ’s hydro/geothermal** stations have near-zero marginal costs and run continuously.
* **The "Peaker" Decision:** The **Genesis Huntly Rankine units** (Coal/Gas) act as "Peakers." They have high startup and fuel costs.
* **Pricing Mechanism:** Genesis Energy only dispatches these units when demand exceeds the capacity of cheaper renewables. Once dispatched, the **System Marginal Price (SMP)** spikes to reflect the high marginal cost of thermal generation. The price is set by the most expensive unit required to meet the last kW of demand.

## 3. Hotel Sector: Capacity Control
Hotels face a similar "Merit Order" regarding customer value.

* **The Scenario:** On high-demand dates (e.g., New Year's Eve), inventory is a "constrained perishable resource".
* **The Decision:** If a hotel forecasts 100% occupancy, it must decide whether to accept a current low-rate booking or wait for a higher-paying guest.
* **Pricing Mechanism:** The decision to close discount channels (OTAs) is equivalent to "dispatching" the high rate (Rack Rate). The price is not based on the cost of cleaning the room, but on the **Opportunity Cost** of displacing a high-value corporate or leisure guest.

## 4. Conclusion: The Shadow Price
The fundamental link between these industries is the concept of **Shadow Price**.

* For **Genesis**, the shadow price is the cost of the next MW available when the grid is congested (Thermal MC).
* For a **Hotel**, the shadow price is the value of the last remaining room when fully booked.

> **Key Takeaway:** In both cases, when the system hits capacity constraints, the price must rise to reflect the true scarcity value of the asset.
